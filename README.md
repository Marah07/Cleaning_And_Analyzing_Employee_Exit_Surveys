# Cleaning_And_Analyzing_Employee_Exit_Surveys

In this project, I worked with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. Some slight modifications to these datasets have been made to make them easier to work with, including changing the encoding to UTF-8 (the original ones are encoded using cp1252.)

Our end goal is to answer the following question:
Are employees who have only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction ? What about employees who have been at the job longer ?
